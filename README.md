# Hi, I'm Kiire Constantine 👋

Self-taught software developer with a strong interest in systems programming, backend engineering, and low-level technologies. I enjoy deeply understanding how things work rather than just using abstractions.

Currently focused on improving my engineering skills through real projects, exploring system design, and building production-ready applications.
